// event listeners for each button
// when a number button is clicked is it added to an empty variable
// when a operator is clicked the text box becomes empty and the next number can be input
// clicking multiple operators.. the last operator clicked is the one used.
// that will run when the = button is clicked
// the clear button will remove the numbers from the variable
